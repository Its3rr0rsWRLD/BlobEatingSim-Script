## What is it?
It's a hub. For scripts. Duh. The name is random :3

## Supported Games
https://www.roblox.com/games/17240213780/Blob-Eating-Simulator

## Running the script
Paste `loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Its3rr0rsWRLD/BlobEatingSim-Script/main/source'))()`

## Recommended Executor
![celery](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24e073c8-6ea0-43d9-a975-27166e33a5e8)

This is the executor I personally use, it has lots of users, works great, and I haven't seen anything suspicious
It's also the first executor I have personally used that doesn't get flagged by my (strict) antivirus when running (Kaspersky)
